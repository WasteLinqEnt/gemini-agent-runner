always use docstrings (keep them simple)
always respect flake8 linelength 
always remove unused imports
never write placeholders even if you have to guess at the downstream impl, just follw up and impl that too 
no simplificatiosn no `for now` code no simulations all code must be real production code 
prefer small single function changes with all depend chaains resolved

we prefer a structure like appname/services/some_service.py ratrher than appname/services.py
